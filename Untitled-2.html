                I graduated from Universal Technical Institute in Illinois with a certificate in Automotive/Diesel technology back in 2014. Before that I was in the
                 U.S. Army for 6 years as an Airborne Infantryman, while I was on active duty I was deployed to West Baghdad from December 2008 to December 2009 where I 
                 helped conduct urban operations and raids. I'm a father to 2 boys, a 7 year old and 9 year old. In my freetime I like to play videogames when I can,
                  work on cars and help my friends work on cars. I also enjoy going to the range to do some long range shooting.</b></p></div>
